## Overview
The goal of this project is to create a machine learning model that can predict whether a patient has heart disease based on various health metrics. This involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes several features related to heart health:
- Age
- Sex
- Chest Pain Type
- Resting Blood Pressure
- Serum Cholesterol
- Fasting Blood Sugar
- Resting Electrocardiographic Results
- Maximum Heart Rate Achieved
- Exercise Induced Angina
- ST Depression
- Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment
- Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy
- Thalassemia

The target variable is whether the patient has heart disease.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
Initial analysis includes visualizing the distribution of various features and their relationships with the target variable. Key steps include:
- Visualizing age distribution and its relation to heart disease
- Analyzing the distribution of other features like sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, etc.
- Creating cross-tabulations to understand the relationships between categorical features and the target

## Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing steps include:
- Handling missing values
- Encoding categorical variables
- Normalizing numerical features
- Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets

## Model Training and Evaluation
Several machine learning models are trained and evaluated on the dataset:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier

The evaluation metrics include:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score

## Results
The results of the models are evaluated based on the metrics mentioned above, with detailed analysis provided in the notebook.

## Conclusion
The project demonstrates the process of building a predictive model for heart disease, covering all the essential steps from data preprocessing to model evaluation and experimentation.
